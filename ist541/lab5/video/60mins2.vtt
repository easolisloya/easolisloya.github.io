00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.200
the idea was an accident a day after 
president trump's inauguration in 2017  

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.280
mcadoo was hanging out with friends 
in memphis on the roof of a building  

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.480
they heard demonstrators in the streets below i 
remember thinking it would be very interesting if  

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.520
someone was in this situation with a sign that had 
nothing to do with anything that's going on here  

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.560
and so how did you get to birds aren't real as 
the thing that's on the sign i don't even know  

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.800
it was just the most absurd thing i could think 
of i'm angry and i'm here to protest sign in hand  

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.920
he took to the streets of memphis ad-libbing a 
stream of absurdities wake up america birds are  

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.080
not real they're admit they're an illusion 
thank you for your time his friends lauren  

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.040
cursed ali perkins and jenny bailey couldn't 
believe what was coming out of peter's mouth

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720
peter just goes all out and he just starts like 
screaming like random stuff like off the top of  

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.760
his head like just whatever he thought of at the 
moment and it's not scripted he's just a hundred  

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.840
percent improvising this moment yeah he's like 
birds aren't real they're a lie and just like  

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.760
whatever would come up to his head he'd like 
say it it was just incredible how he created  

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.600
this whole character and personality off the bat 
like his improv quickly yeah this is impressive  

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.600
we're like okay where did this come from there is 
a pademic happening peter's friend ali innocently  

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.880
posted a video of that day online and then 
everything changed so i'm getting pictures sent  

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.240
to me if birds aren't real graffiti and birds are 
on chalkboards and seeing you know you know chants  

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.960
in cafeterias and you know stadiums like birds 
aren't real at high schools did you think at  

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.320
that point like this is awesome or what have i 
done i remember being fascinated by it i remember  

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.800
thinking okay why do people identify with this so 
much and just thinking like there was this energy  

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.200
in memphis for this idea and that i would 
always regret it if i didn't lean into that
